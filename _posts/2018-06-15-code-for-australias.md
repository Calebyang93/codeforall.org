#### WHAT IS TECH FOR NON TECH?

[Code for Australia](http://codeforaustralia.org/)’s Tech for Non Tech program provides examples and insights from real software development teams, taught without the technological jargon. It is a one day course that fills a need for technical knowledge discussed in simple language. The program started in New Zealand in 2016 by [_Enspiral Dev Academy_](http://devacademy.co.nz/) who are experienced providers of web development bootcamps aimed at people who want to be developers.

Tech for Non Tech is not just aimed at people who are interested in becoming developers or designers, but those who wish to work better with them. The classes have been rolled out across Australia, helping participants enhance the success of their development projects. Designed specifically to serve those who categorise themselves as non-technical people, the course deepens their understanding of development and design processes with real work examples. Here are the reflections of an early participant.

> _I was happy to find that Tech for Non Tech is by no means a Tech for Dummies course. The workshop equips participants with some basic tools to tackle tech jargon, understand key tech concepts and processes, and ultimately (most importantly), to understand how to work with developers._ [_Anna Jackson early participant_](https://medium.com/enspiral-dev-academy/what-goes-down-in-tech-for-non-tech-c5db5e783151)

There are three main pillars to the learnings that Tech for Non Tech enables.

#### _1\. DISCOVER — TECHNOLOGY BASICS_

Sometimes people (or at least I do) think that technology is this mystical thing far beyond comprehension. In reality we carry it around in our pockets every day, meet our future husbands and order most of what is in our homes with it. Technology enables faster communication, facilitates relationships and delivers our everyday needs. So where do you fit into all of that? Well you are already a consumer of technology, so why not think about the ways in which you can contribute to the delivery of it? Tech for Non Tech, gives people the opportunity to uncover a high level understanding of trends and opportunity within emerging fields as well as have an insightful experience of the working practices that enable timely, targeted deliverables.

#### _2\. DESIGN — LANGUAGE + CONCEPTS_

Hanging out with a bunch of developers and designers who work in the software development space, can lead to jargon fatigue pretty quickly. Tech for Non Tech helps professionals cut through that barrier to participation by gaining a deeper understanding of basic terms. This allows collaborators to know what they are asking developers and to get the best out of their multidisciplinary team. For example it might not be appropriate to ask a dev team to change the language they are working in without consultation but it does make sense to ask them what it is going to take if that was the road you wanted to go down. Sometimes asking the right questions lead to the most elegant solutions. There are so man TLA (three letter acronyms) flying around it can make your head spin. What is a DNS? FYI (For Your Information…I HAD to do it) the best definition of a DNS that I could find was this.

> _DNS translates human-language domain names — guardian.co.uk or wikileaks.org, for example — into machine-readable “IP addresses”. These allow the users’ computer to connect to the destination web server and get to what they’re after._ [**Josh Halliday**](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/03/dns-ip-ddos-explained)

#### _3\. DELIVER — TECH RELATIONSHIPS_

Technology doesn’t create software, teams of people do! Participants get the chance to investigate multiple ways to develop so that they can help identify with developers the solutions that are right for their organisation. The future of work will require digital fluency at a level beyond programming or design. Understanding the entire ecosystem is what will be required. This mindset up level starts now and one skill that that is always in demand is the ability to learn new skills. This is what Tech for Non Tech is focussed on.

I’m a furniture designer turned front end dev turned service designer who, to this day doesn’t categorise myself as a tech head, regardless of the fact that I have gained the understanding necessary to collaborate with developers. I’ve had the privilege of seeing behind the curtain to how technology waves it’s magic wand and connects data with people in a meaningful way.

People find their place in technical teams through the Tech for Non Tech program. There can be a barrier to participation that jargon supports. Simple language and straight forward examples of technology and developers in action is such a powerful tool for bringing more people in the process of building new solutions. Engaging non technical people (or as we have found out, people who just don’t think they are technical but most likely are) in the development of new technologies key to building stuff that…well makes sense to people.

This happens through an introduction to basic programming languages and ensuring a contextual understanding executed solutions. The real mind set uplevel comes from learning about the best way to achieve these solutions. It’s not simply about solving problems through technology, but ensuring that the right problems are solved in the right way for your business.

The really exciting aspect of Tech for Non Tech is that individualised and far reaching solutions will empower more people in the future to solve some of the trickiest problems.

#### WHAT IS CODE FOR ALL?

You might have noticed this article is under the Code for All publication. You might then be wondering, who is Code for All, what do they do, and why do they care about digital fluency?

Code for All is a global network and community of civic tech practitioners who work with government bodies across the world to bring the best human centred design and technical development practices into projects.

But what is civic tech?

From my time with Code for Australia (one of the Code for All partners), I came to understand that **civic tech** means giving the general public and government workers a voice by considering everyone’s needs in software that’s made for public benefit. Individuals hold enormous power to create impact for social change and civic tech is one of the most effective ways to drive change.

#### WHY DOES THIS PROGRAM MATTER?

The Tech for Non Tech model has great potential to increase the success of digital products across the globe. It’s well known that great software development takes discovery, communication and delivery, all considered from the needs of people closest to the problem. This might look very different in Bulgaria than it does in India.

The Code for All community has a long list of experienced individuals able to deliver their knowledge to Tech for Non Tech participants in a meaningful way, so the opportunity is to have individual programs run in different countries. In order to increase productivity in tech teams, they must enable the participation of many.

#### WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN?

As many hands make light work, many perspectives add to the richness and relevancy of tech solutions. Now, digital solutions permeate every aspect of our lives, so technical solutions require people like you! They require the inherent knowledge of many types of individuals from all walks of life. Many people are trying to affect change from within broken systems. There is an opportunity to harness digital innovation to work with the public that they are serving, not just on their behalf, by finding new ways of addressing old problems.

By understanding the mystical process of software development participants benefit from learning the skills to engage more effectively with teams developing software within their organisations. The focus is on how to engage with technology and developers, but perhaps more importantly it’s about empowering people to see how they can add value through problem definition and process improvements.

Processes don’t make tech great, people do.
