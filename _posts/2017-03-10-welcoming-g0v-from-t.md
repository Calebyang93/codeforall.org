From [Code for Taiwan (g0v)](http://g0v.asia/)

Governments are facing enormous pressure to deliver for their citizens today. Our network has been supporting an international community of technologists and their government partners to share knowledge, code and resources with each other to help governments meet this challenge.

Today, we are pleased to welcome g0v community from Taiwan.

[**g0v community** (read gov-zero](http://g0v.tw/en-US/)), with 200 active members and an online community of more than 2500, has been pushing for information transparency in Taiwan for the last five years. The community organized around economic policy issues debated in Taiwan in 2012. Their first event, the g0v.tw hackathon, led to the development of more than fifty projects and collaboration with government agencies and civil society organizations. g0v has since partnered with various offices of the Taiwanese government and civil society organizations to organize hackathons and other civic tech projects. g0v is being backed by a non-profit [Open Culture Foundation](https://ocf.tw/en/).

Check out their work, and stay tuned for more updates from Code for All!
